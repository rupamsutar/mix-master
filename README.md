✨✨ Hey everyone! ✨✨

This Saturday was all about diving into the latest React Router v6.15.0, and let me tell you, it's one of the most powerful routers I've experienced in my development journey. The whole new syntax, routing structure, and error handling mechanisms are top-notch, making navigation really simple !

🧩 What impressed me the most was the whole new way of defining routes as objects and nesting them elegantly using the 'children' key. Error handling is now more intuitive and the built-in loaders for data fetching before component rendering? Simply amazing!

💅 Taking it up a notch, I played around with styled components for styling. The experience was transformative; I styled all the wrappers using styled components, making my code sleek and maintainable.

🚀 To optimize data fetching, I delved into React Query, caching requests for 5 mins to enhance performance. It's incredible how this simple step can boost the user experience.
